Use 1 repo per project. Keep your best code in the master branch. Mark versions using tags.

When you want to make a change/improvement, make a new branch, make your edits, commit them, test that the new code works, and, when you're comfortable with the change, merge the branch into master and delete the branch.

Git lets you go back to any commit and recover the state of the repo, so there is no need for manually copying the whole project (moreover, doing so is not scalable as Git will keep complete copies of each copy).

How to plan properly (the business owner guide):
1. Write down all the features.
2. Put each feature on a card.
3. Buy a foam wall.
4. Stick each card on the wall, spread them out.
5. Buy a blindfold.
6. Buy a set of 3 darts.
7. Each time you come in each morning, throw the darts at the wall with the blindfold on.
8. Whichever features are nearest the darts get priority.
9. Feed requirements to product owners and tell them to plan appropriately.
10. Repeat steps 7-9 each day.
